This repo is my starting point for creating a class that could expand on the 'audioOutputExample' in openframeworks to include synthesis tools without wrapping a 3rd party library. This class would make audio synthesis and effects as easy as calling methods such as ofCircle that are simply in the OF core. This is a first shot at organizing such a class but please feel free to add. I'm interested in implementing audio synthesis, effects, and sequencing.  

NOTE: PLEASE KEEP ACTUAL COMPUTER VOLUME LOW WHEN WORKING WITH AUDIO. DON'T WEAR HEADPHONES. IT CAN GET EXTREMELY LOUD.
